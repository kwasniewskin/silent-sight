# Silent Sight v8.5 🎯

> A tactical browser-based sniper game designed and directed by @kwasniewskin, powered by AI code generation.

## 🎮 About The Game
**Silent Sight** is a 2D sniper arcade game where precision meets strategy. You take on the role of a specialist sniper, tasked with identifying targets based on specific mission briefings while accounting for wind speed, distance, and environmental conditions.

### The Development Process
This project explores the capabilities of human-AI collaboration.
* **Concept & Design:** All gameplay mechanics, visual style, and game logic rules were designed by the developer.
* **Implementation:** The raw code (HTML/JS/Canvas) was generated by **Google Gemini** under strict supervision and iterative prompting.
* **Refinement:** The code was reviewed, debugged, and optimized by the developer to ensure gameplay balance and ethical constraints (e.g., target filtering logic).

## ✨ Features
* **Ballistics System:** Account for wind speed/direction and distance drop (simulated).
* **Dynamic Environments:** Day and Night cycles affecting visibility.
* **Traffic System:** Moving cars and trucks that interact with shots.
* **Living World:** Background birds, civilians, and variable architecture.
* **Mission Variety:** Targets vary by age, hats, hair style, accessories, and pets.
* **Safety Logic:** Custom algorithms ensure children are strictly excluded from being targets.

## 🕹️ How to Play
1.  **Read the Briefing:** Check the target profile (e.g., "Adult, Red Hat, Walking a Dog").
2.  **Check Conditions:** Look at the Wind and Distance indicators in the HUD.
3.  **Aim:** Use your mouse to move the scope.
4.  **Compensate:**
    * If wind is blowing **Right (>>)**, aim slightly to the **Left**.
    * If target is **Far (Dist > 0)**, aim slightly **Higher**.
5.  **Fire:** Click the Left Mouse Button to shoot.
6.  **Avoid Civilians:** Shooting the wrong target fails the mission.
